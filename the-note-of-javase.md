# The note of JavaSE

## Intro. to some concepts in Java

Java (the programming language):  
Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based,
object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementaion dependencies as
possible.

Java (software platform):  
* Multi-paradigm: generic, object-oriented(class-based), imperative, reflective
* Typing discipline: static, strong, safe, nominative, manifest

Java platform, standard edition:  
* JavaSE is a coputing platform for development and deployment of portable code
for desktop & server environments.
* The platform uses Java programming language and is part of the Java
  software-platform family. JavaSE defines a range of general-purpose APIs-such
as Java APIs for the Java Class Library - and also includes the Java Language
Specification and the Java Virtual Machine Specification.
* One of the most well-known implementations of JavaSE is Oracle Corporation's
  Java Development Kit (JDK).

JDK. (Java Development Kit):  
The JDK. is an implementation of either one of the Java Platform, Standard
Edition, Java Platform, Enterprise Edition, or Java Platform Micro Edition
released by Oracle Corporation in the form of a binary product aimed at Java
developer on Solaris, Linux, macOS or Windows.

JRE. (Java Runtime Environment):  

JVM. (Java Virtual Machine):  
* A java virtual machine is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode. The JVM is detailed by a specification that formally describes what is required in a JVM implementation.
* The JVM reference implementation is developed by the OpenJDK project as open
  source and includes a JIT compiler called HotSpot. The commercially supported
Java releases available from Oracel Corporation are based on the OpenJDK
runtime. Eclipse OpenJ9 is another open souece JVM for OpenJDK.

Java License:  
* Purchase the subscription
	* early access to bug fixes
	* licensing and support for cloud, server and desktop deployments.
	* some performance, stability, and security updates.
	* around the clock support.



Identity name rules:  
* number + letter + underscore + $
* DON'T use number at the first letter.

Examples:  
* 小驼峰命名法 (for method & variables): name, setName()
* 大驼峰命名法 (for class): Scanner
